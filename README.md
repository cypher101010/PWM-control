# PWM-control

This is one of the first project's i ever coded for the Arduino platform.

# Required components:
  - Arduino Board
  - 7 segment display module (without the driver board)
  - 1 LED
  - 7 470 ohm resistor's
  - 2 10k ohm resistor's
  - 2 push button's
  
# How it work's:
  - We have 2 pushbutton's, one of them is increasing and the other one is decreasing the brightness of the LED
  - The LED brighness is represented in 10 level (from 0 to 9) wich can be seen on the 7s display
  - Each of the values used in this code are printed on in the serial console
